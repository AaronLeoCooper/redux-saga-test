# redux-saga-test

This is a test project build on top of [CRA][cra]
purely for fun and learning a few techniques needed in the
application of: redux, redux-act, redux-saga in a working app
with unit tests.

This was only built to display GitHub profiles in a very basic
UI that uses the awesome free [Ant Design for react][antd] library.

Build/run commands and config are all unchanged from [CRA][cra].

For all available commands, check out `scripts` inside `package.json`.
