# redux-saga-test

This is a test project build on top of [CRA][CRA]
purely for fun and learning a few techniques needed in the
application of: redux, redux-act, redux-saga in a working app.

It's completely lacking unit tests or any code quality tools
and was only built to display GitHub profiles in a very basic
UI that uses the awesome free [Ant Design for react][ANTD] library.

Build/run commands and config are all unchanged from [CRA][CRA].

For all available commands, check out `scripts` inside `package.json`.
